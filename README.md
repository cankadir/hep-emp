# HEP EMP

Code for the Environmental Monitoring Plan 2018 Interactive Map, which identifies active, continuous, and nonactive (or historic) environmental monitoring efforts by the New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary Program (HEP) and its many partners.

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Clone this repository and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Much of the map data resides in Mapbox, so you will need access to the Mapbox account to make changes to that data.

## Deployment

```bash
npm run build
```

Zip the contents of `build/` and upload to the server.
